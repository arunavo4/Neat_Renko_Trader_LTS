### NEAT Based Trader on Renko Graphs

The Basic idea for this Trader is to look into a square of `32x32` Obs Space of past Renko Graph and trade a given stock `action: Buy | Sell | Hold`.

This is based off implementation of NEAT from `neat-python` and also uses the pytorch version of `NEAT` from `UBER` for the neural network `RNN`.

#### Further Development
This project is gonna be superseded by the use of `Weight Agnostic Neural Networks` Version of `NEAT` from Google DeepMind and also the `DeepGA` from `Uber`.
